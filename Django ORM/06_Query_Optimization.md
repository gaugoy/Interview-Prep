# Module 06: Query Optimization

This file contains structured interview questions and detailed answers targeting Django ORM concepts at Senior, Lead, and Architect levels.

---

# Question 1: What is the difference between select_related and prefetch_related?

## Answer

The N+1 query problem occurs when the application executes one query to fetch parent records and then N additional queries to fetch related children records. To eliminate this, Django provides `select_related` (which performs a SQL JOIN for single-valued relationships like ForeignKey or OneToOneField) and `prefetch_related` (which performs a separate SQL query with an `IN` clause to fetch multi-valued relations like ManyToManyField or reverse ForeignKeys, then joins them in Python memory).

## Practical Example

```python
# Optimized: select_related performs a single SQL JOIN
books = Book.objects.select_related('author').filter(in_print=True)
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # No additional DB query

# Optimized: prefetch_related executes exactly 2 queries
authors = Author.objects.prefetch_related('books').all()
for author in authors:
    print(author.books.all())  # Read from Python memory cache
```

## Production Considerations

In microservice environments or high-throughput systems, prefetching can consume considerable application memory if the fetched dataset is large. Always limit fields retrieved using `.only()` or `.defer()` when prefetching massive tables.

## Performance Impact

Changes database complexity from O(N) queries to O(1) or O(K) where K is the number of prefetched relationships. This reduces latency significantly.

## Common Mistakes

Using `prefetch_related` and then applying filters on the related manager inside a loop (e.g., `author.books.filter(genre='sci-fi')`), which completely bypasses the prefetch cache and triggers an additional SQL query.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. How does Django's Prefetch object allow filtering of prefetched querysets?
2. What is the difference in SQL structure between select_related and prefetch_related?
3. How do you clear or reset the prefetch cache of a model instance?

# Question 2: When does prefetch_related write a new query, and how is it executed?

## Answer

The N+1 query problem occurs when the application executes one query to fetch parent records and then N additional queries to fetch related children records. To eliminate this, Django provides `select_related` (which performs a SQL JOIN for single-valued relationships like ForeignKey or OneToOneField) and `prefetch_related` (which performs a separate SQL query with an `IN` clause to fetch multi-valued relations like ManyToManyField or reverse ForeignKeys, then joins them in Python memory).

## Practical Example

```python
# Optimized: select_related performs a single SQL JOIN
books = Book.objects.select_related('author').filter(in_print=True)
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # No additional DB query

# Optimized: prefetch_related executes exactly 2 queries
authors = Author.objects.prefetch_related('books').all()
for author in authors:
    print(author.books.all())  # Read from Python memory cache
```

## Production Considerations

In microservice environments or high-throughput systems, prefetching can consume considerable application memory if the fetched dataset is large. Always limit fields retrieved using `.only()` or `.defer()` when prefetching massive tables.

## Performance Impact

# Question 10: How do you write a query to avoid the N+1 problem on reverse foreign keys?

## Answer

The N+1 query problem occurs when the application executes one query to fetch parent records and then N additional queries to fetch related children records. To eliminate this, Django provides `select_related` (which performs a SQL JOIN for single-valued relationships like ForeignKey or OneToOneField) and `prefetch_related` (which performs a separate SQL query with an `IN` clause to fetch multi-valued relations like ManyToManyField or reverse ForeignKeys, then joins them in Python memory).

## Practical Example

```python
# Optimized: select_related performs a single SQL JOIN
books = Book.objects.select_related('author').filter(in_print=True)
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # No additional DB query

# Optimized: prefetch_related executes exactly 2 queries
authors = Author.objects.prefetch_related('books').all()
for author in authors:

# Question 13: How do you optimize large scale deletions using Django ORM?

## Answer

Scaling Django ORM to handle tables with 500 million or more rows requires combining application-level optimization with database-level physical design. The ORM cannot rely on default sequential scans. Key strategies include: 1) Physical database table partitioning (range, list, hash) to keep active working sets small, 2) Strict indexing strategies (partial, composite, functional) to match query patterns, 3) Caching layers (Redis/Memcached) to avoid hitting the database for read-heavy operations, 4) Read-replica query routing, and 5) Keyset pagination to replace heavy OFFSET-based queries.

## Practical Example

```python
# Utilizing a partitioned field (e.g., date) in filtering to prune partitions:
import datetime

# Good: Hits specific partition index directly
recent_logs = SecurityLog.objects.filter(
    created_at__gte=datetime.date(2026, 6, 1),
    status='failed'
)[:100]
```

## Production Considerations

Standard Django operations like `count()` can cause full table scans and block database resources on large tables. Implement caching for counts, or use approximate counts from database metadata (e.g., pg_class in PostgreSQL).

## Performance Impact

Reduces query evaluation time from minutes (due to scanning 500M rows) to milliseconds by targeting specific partitions and indexes.

## Common Mistakes

Using offset pagination (`LIMIT 100 OFFSET 1000000`) on a 500M row table. The database must scan and discard 1 million rows before returning the 100 rows, leading to severe latency.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. How do you implement keyset pagination in Django ORM?
2. How does table partitioning affect unique database constraints in PostgreSQL?
3. How do you configure database routers to distribute reads across multiple replicas?

    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

## Production Considerations

Always verify the database schema constraints generated in migrations. Ensure validation rules match at both application and database level to prevent corrupt data.

## Performance Impact

Minimizes application latency by reducing database roundtrips, utilizing query caching, and avoiding heavy table scans.

## Common Mistakes

Hardcoding configurations or bypassing standard ORM abstraction levels, which breaks database driver portability.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. How does this feature behave under high concurrent write load?
2. How do you write a Django unit test to validate this behavior?
3. What is the migration rollback strategy for this configuration?

# Question 24: How do you run raw SQL queries without bypassing Django's security filters?

## Answer

This concept covers advanced database configurations and behaviors for: 'How do you run raw SQL queries without bypassing Django's security filters?'. It deals with persistence rules, validation, and integration with the backend engine.

## Practical Example

```python
# Standard advanced configuration pattern
from django.db import models

class AuditModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True
