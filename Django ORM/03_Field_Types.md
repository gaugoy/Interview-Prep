# Question 7: How does Django handle JSONField querying and indexing?

## Answer

Indexes speed up data retrieval by providing quick lookups at the expense of write latency and disk space. Django supports defining standard indexes, partial indexes (with conditions), composite indexes (spanning multiple fields), and functional indexes (using database expressions/functions) in the model Meta options.

## Practical Example

```python
# Functional and Partial Index in model Meta:
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(
            fields=['last_name', 'first_name'],
            name='author_name_idx'
        ),
        models.Index(
            OpClass(Lower('email'), name='varchar_pattern_ops'),
            name='author_email_lower_idx'
        ),
    ]
```

## Production Considerations

Always create indexes concurrently in production using custom SQL or database migration wrappers to prevent locking the table for writes during index creation.

## Performance Impact

Changes lookups from O(N) sequential scan to O(log N) index seek. However, too many indexes slow down INSERT/UPDATE writes.

## Common Mistakes

Indexing columns with low cardinality (e.g., booleans like `is_active`), where the database optimizer will ignore the index and perform a full table scan anyway.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. What is the difference between unique_together and UniqueConstraint?
2. How do you index a JSONField key in Django for PostgreSQL?
3. When should you use a composite index over multiple single-field indexes?
