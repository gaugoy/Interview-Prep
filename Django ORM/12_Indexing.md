# Module 12: Database Indexing & Constraints

This file contains structured interview questions and detailed answers targeting Django ORM concepts at Senior, Lead, and Architect levels.

---

# Question 1: What is a database index and how do you declare it in Django?

## Answer

Indexes speed up data retrieval by providing quick lookups at the expense of write latency and disk space. Django supports defining standard indexes, partial indexes (with conditions), composite indexes (spanning multiple fields), and functional indexes (using database expressions/functions) in the model Meta options.

## Practical Example

```python
# Functional and Partial Index in model Meta:
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(
            fields=['last_name', 'first_name'],
            name='author_name_idx'
        ),
        models.Index(
            OpClass(Lower('email'), name='varchar_pattern_ops'),
            name='author_email_lower_idx'
        ),
    ]
```

## Production Considerations

Always create indexes concurrently in production using custom SQL or database migration wrappers to prevent locking the table for writes during index creation.

## Performance Impact

Changes lookups from O(N) sequential scan to O(log N) index seek. However, too many indexes slow down INSERT/UPDATE writes.

## Common Mistakes

Indexing columns with low cardinality (e.g., booleans like `is_active`), where the database optimizer will ignore the index and perform a full table scan anyway.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. What is the difference between unique_together and UniqueConstraint?
2. How do you index a JSONField key in Django for PostgreSQL?
3. When should you use a composite index over multiple single-field indexes?

# Question 16: How does Django handle index renaming and deletion in migrations?

## Answer

Migrating a multi-terabyte table with zero downtime requires a multi-phase write-and-sync strategy. Running a standard Django migration with a DDL change (e.g., adding a column with a default value or changing a data type) will lock the table, causing a production outage. The architecture pattern is: 1) Add the new column as nullable without a default value (light DDL lock), 2) Update code to write to both old and new columns, 3) Run a background data migration to backfill historical data in small batches, 4) Add default constraints and make the column non-nullable (if required) using separate lock-safe migrations, 5) Clean up and deploy code referencing only the new column.

## Practical Example

```python
# Inside a custom data migration using batch processing:
def backfill_data(apps, schema_editor):
    UserActivity = apps.get_model('analytics', 'UserActivity')
    batch_size = 5000
    last_id = 0
    while True:
        # Keyset pagination to prevent memory bloat and slow offsets
        batch = UserActivity.objects.filter(id__gt=last_id).order_by('id')[:batch_size]
        if not batch.exists():
            break
        for item in batch:
            item.new_field = transform(item.old_field)
        # Perform bulk update for this batch
        UserActivity.objects.bulk_update(batch, ['new_field'])
        last_id = batch[len(batch)-1].id
```

## Production Considerations

Always disable auto-commit and run background backfills in separate transactions to avoid holding locks. Use rate limiters to sleep between batches to allow replica replication and prevent replica lag.

## Performance Impact

Prevents long-running locks on the table, maintaining application response times during schema and data migrations.

## Common Mistakes

Running a single large migration query like `UPDATE my_table SET new_col = old_col` on a 2TB table, which will lock the table, blow up the transaction log (WAL), and crash the database.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. How do you use PostgreSQL's VACUUM or pg_repack after migrating data?
2. How do you write a Django migration that runs raw SQL concurrently?
3. What is the role of django_migrations table during zero-downtime deployment?

# Question 17: How do you create an index concurrently in PostgreSQL without locking the table?

## Answer

Concurrency conflicts arise when multiple requests attempt to read and write the same database record simultaneously. Django provides: 1) Optimistic locking (verifying record version on update using F expressions or version checks), 2) Pessimistic locking (locking rows using `select_for_update()`). Pessimistic locks prevent other queries from modifying or reading locked rows depending on lock parameters.

## Practical Example

```python
# Pessimistic locking: locks the row until the transaction commits
with transaction.atomic():
    account = Account.objects.select_for_update().get(id=1)
    account.balance -= amount
    account.save()
```

## Production Considerations

Using `select_for_update()` without a timeout or parameters like `nowait=True` or `skip_locked=True` can lead to application workers hanging and waiting indefinitely for locks, causing cascading timeouts.

## Performance Impact

Guarantees data consistency at the cost of concurrency. `skip_locked=True` improves performance when designing queue consumers by letting workers skip busy rows.

## Common Mistakes

Using `select_for_update()` outside of a transaction block. In Django, this raises a TransactionManagementError because locks require an open transaction boundary.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. What is the difference between nowait=True and skip_locked=True?
2. How does select_for_update work with related models via the 'of' argument?
3. How do you write a test for optimistic lock conflicts?

## Production Considerations

Always create indexes concurrently in production using custom SQL or database migration wrappers to prevent locking the table for writes during index creation.

## Performance Impact

Changes lookups from O(N) sequential scan to O(log N) index seek. However, too many indexes slow down INSERT/UPDATE writes.

## Common Mistakes

Indexing columns with low cardinality (e.g., booleans like `is_active`), where the database optimizer will ignore the index and perform a full table scan anyway.

# Question 20: How does query optimizer use indexes when executing ORM queries?

## Answer

Indexes speed up data retrieval by providing quick lookups at the expense of write latency and disk space. Django supports defining standard indexes, partial indexes (with conditions), composite indexes (spanning multiple fields), and functional indexes (using database expressions/functions) in the model Meta options.

## Practical Example

```python
# Functional and Partial Index in model Meta:
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(
            fields=['last_name', 'first_name'],
            name='author_name_idx'
        ),
        models.Index(
            OpClass(Lower('email'), name='varchar_pattern_ops'),
            name='author_email_lower_idx'
        ),
    ]
```

# Question 22: How do you enforce database-level validation using CheckConstraint?

## Answer

This concept covers advanced database configurations and behaviors for: 'How do you enforce database-level validation using CheckConstraint?'. It deals with persistence rules, validation, and integration with the backend engine.

## Practical Example

```python
# Standard advanced configuration pattern
from django.db import models

class AuditModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

## Production Considerations

Always verify the database schema constraints generated in migrations. Ensure validation rules match at both application and database level to prevent corrupt data.

## Performance Impact

Minimizes application latency by reducing database roundtrips, utilizing query caching, and avoiding heavy table scans.

## Common Mistakes

Hardcoding configurations or bypassing standard ORM abstraction levels, which breaks database driver portability.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. How does this feature behave under high concurrent write load?
2. How do you write a Django unit test to validate this behavior?
3. What is the migration rollback strategy for this configuration?
