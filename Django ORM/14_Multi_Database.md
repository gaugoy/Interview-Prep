# Question 1: How do you configure multiple database connections in DATABASES setting?

## Answer

This concept covers advanced database configurations and behaviors for: 'How do you configure multiple database connections in DATABASES setting?'. It deals with persistence rules, validation, and integration with the backend engine.

## Practical Example

```python
# Standard advanced configuration pattern
from django.db import models

class AuditModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

## Production Considerations

Always verify the database schema constraints generated in migrations. Ensure validation rules match at both application and database level to prevent corrupt data.

## Performance Impact

Minimizes application latency by reducing database roundtrips, utilizing query caching, and avoiding heavy table scans.

## Common Mistakes

Hardcoding configurations or bypassing standard ORM abstraction levels, which breaks database driver portability.

    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

## Production Considerations

# Question 3: How do the four router methods work (db_for_read, db_for_write, allow_relation, allow_migrate)?

## Answer

Migrating a multi-terabyte table with zero downtime requires a multi-phase write-and-sync strategy. Running a standard Django migration with a DDL change (e.g., adding a column with a default value or changing a data type) will lock the table, causing a production outage. The architecture pattern is: 1) Add the new column as nullable without a default value (light DDL lock), 2) Update code to write to both old and new columns, 3) Run a background data migration to backfill historical data in small batches, 4) Add default constraints and make the column non-nullable (if required) using separate lock-safe migrations, 5) Clean up and deploy code referencing only the new column.

## Practical Example

```python
# Inside a custom data migration using batch processing:
def backfill_data(apps, schema_editor):
    UserActivity = apps.get_model('analytics', 'UserActivity')
    batch_size = 5000
    last_id = 0
    while True:
        # Keyset pagination to prevent memory bloat and slow offsets
        batch = UserActivity.objects.filter(id__gt=last_id).order_by('id')[:batch_size]
        if not batch.exists():
            break
        for item in batch:
            item.new_field = transform(item.old_field)
        # Perform bulk update for this batch
        UserActivity.objects.bulk_update(batch, ['new_field'])
        last_id = batch[len(batch)-1].id
```

## Production Considerations

Always disable auto-commit and run background backfills in separate transactions to avoid holding locks. Use rate limiters to sleep between batches to allow replica replication and prevent replica lag.

## Performance Impact

Prevents long-running locks on the table, maintaining application response times during schema and data migrations.

## Common Mistakes

Running a single large migration query like `UPDATE my_table SET new_col = old_col` on a 2TB table, which will lock the table, blow up the transaction log (WAL), and crash the database.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

2. How do you write a Django migration that runs raw SQL concurrently?
3. What is the role of django_migrations table during zero-downtime deployment?

# Question 12: How do you handle distributed transactions across multiple databases in Django?

## Answer

Django manages database transactions using `transaction.atomic()`. When entering an atomic block, Django opens a transaction (or creates a savepoint if nested). If the block executes successfully, the changes are committed. If an exception is raised, the changes are rolled back. Internally, Django wraps connection operations with autocommit controls to enforce transaction limits.

## Practical Example

```python
from django.db import transaction

try:
    with transaction.atomic():
        user.save()
        profile.save()
        # If either fails, both roll back
except DatabaseError:
        # Handle rollback recovery
```

## Production Considerations

Keep atomic blocks as short as possible. Performing external API requests or slow operations inside atomic blocks holds database locks open longer, starving connection pools.

## Performance Impact

Groups multiple writes into a single commit, reducing IO overhead. However, long-running transactions increase table and row locking times.

## Common Mistakes

Catching database exceptions inside an atomic block without letting the block fail, which raises a `TransactionManagementError` on subsequent database writes because the transaction is marked as broken.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. How does transaction.on_commit() ensure safety for side effects?
2. What are transaction savepoints and how do nested atomic blocks use them?
3. How do database isolation levels affect transaction conflicts in Django?

1. How does this feature behave under high concurrent write load?
2. How do you write a Django unit test to validate this behavior?
3. What is the migration rollback strategy for this configuration?

# Question 25: Explain Django 5.0's async database backend routing operations.

## Answer

This concept covers advanced database configurations and behaviors for: 'Explain Django 5.0's async database backend routing operations.'. It deals with persistence rules, validation, and integration with the backend engine.

## Practical Example

```python
# Standard advanced configuration pattern
from django.db import models

class AuditModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

## Production Considerations

Always verify the database schema constraints generated in migrations. Ensure validation rules match at both application and database level to prevent corrupt data.

## Performance Impact

Minimizes application latency by reducing database roundtrips, utilizing query caching, and avoiding heavy table scans.

## Common Mistakes

Hardcoding configurations or bypassing standard ORM abstraction levels, which breaks database driver portability.
