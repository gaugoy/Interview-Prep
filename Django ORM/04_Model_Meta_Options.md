# Module 04: Model Meta Options

This file contains structured interview questions and detailed answers targeting Django ORM concepts at Senior, Lead, and Architect levels.

---

# Question 1: What is the purpose of the Model Meta class and how is it evaluated?

## Answer

This concept covers advanced database configurations and behaviors for: 'What is the purpose of the Model Meta class and how is it evaluated?'. It deals with persistence rules, validation, and integration with the backend engine.

## Practical Example

```python
# Standard advanced configuration pattern
from django.db import models

class AuditModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

## Production Considerations

Always verify the database schema constraints generated in migrations. Ensure validation rules match at both application and database level to prevent corrupt data.

## Performance Impact

Minimizes application latency by reducing database roundtrips, utilizing query caching, and avoiding heavy table scans.

## Common Mistakes

Hardcoding configurations or bypassing standard ORM abstraction levels, which breaks database driver portability.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. How does this feature behave under high concurrent write load?
2. How do you write a Django unit test to validate this behavior?
3. What is the migration rollback strategy for this configuration?

---

# Question 2: How does db_table option affect database table naming?

## Answer

    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

## Production Considerations

Always verify the database schema constraints generated in migrations. Ensure validation rules match at both application and database level to prevent corrupt data.

## Performance Impact

Minimizes application latency by reducing database roundtrips, utilizing query caching, and avoiding heavy table scans.

## Common Mistakes

Hardcoding configurations or bypassing standard ORM abstraction levels, which breaks database driver portability.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

# Question 3: How do you define composite or multi-column indexes using indexes in Meta?

## Answer

Indexes speed up data retrieval by providing quick lookups at the expense of write latency and disk space. Django supports defining standard indexes, partial indexes (with conditions), composite indexes (spanning multiple fields), and functional indexes (using database expressions/functions) in the model Meta options.

## Practical Example

```python
# Functional and Partial Index in model Meta:
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(
            fields=['last_name', 'first_name'],
            name='author_name_idx'
        ),
        models.Index(
            OpClass(Lower('email'), name='varchar_pattern_ops'),
            name='author_email_lower_idx'
        ),
    ]
```

## Production Considerations

Always create indexes concurrently in production using custom SQL or database migration wrappers to prevent locking the table for writes during index creation.

## Performance Impact

Changes lookups from O(N) sequential scan to O(log N) index seek. However, too many indexes slow down INSERT/UPDATE writes.

## Common Mistakes

Indexing columns with low cardinality (e.g., booleans like `is_active`), where the database optimizer will ignore the index and perform a full table scan anyway.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. What is the difference between unique_together and UniqueConstraint?
2. How do you index a JSONField key in Django for PostgreSQL?
3. When should you use a composite index over multiple single-field indexes?

# Question 24: How does Django handle index names and constraint names dynamically?

## Answer

Indexes speed up data retrieval by providing quick lookups at the expense of write latency and disk space. Django supports defining standard indexes, partial indexes (with conditions), composite indexes (spanning multiple fields), and functional indexes (using database expressions/functions) in the model Meta options.

## Practical Example

```python
# Functional and Partial Index in model Meta:
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(
            fields=['last_name', 'first_name'],
            name='author_name_idx'
        ),
        models.Index(
            OpClass(Lower('email'), name='varchar_pattern_ops'),
            name='author_email_lower_idx'
        ),
    ]
```

## Production Considerations

Always create indexes concurrently in production using custom SQL or database migration wrappers to prevent locking the table for writes during index creation.

## Performance Impact

Changes lookups from O(N) sequential scan to O(log N) index seek. However, too many indexes slow down INSERT/UPDATE writes.

## Common Mistakes

Indexing columns with low cardinality (e.g., booleans like `is_active`), where the database optimizer will ignore the index and perform a full table scan anyway.
