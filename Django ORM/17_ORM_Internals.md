# Module 17: Django ORM Internals

This file contains structured interview questions and detailed answers targeting Django ORM concepts at Senior, Lead, and Architect levels.

---

# Question 1: What is the role of the Query Compiler in django.db.models.sql?

## Answer

Django ORM Internals consist of the query compilation pipeline. A QuerySet holds a `Query` object. When evaluated, the `Query` object is passed to `django.db.models.sql.compiler.SQLCompiler`. The compiler translates the query tree into raw SQL and parameters, taking care of joins, field selections, aliases, and specific database backend quirks.

## Practical Example

```python
# Accessing internals
queryset = Product.objects.all()
compiler = queryset.query.get_compiler(using='default')
sql, params = compiler.as_sql()
print(sql)
```

## Production Considerations

Understanding compiler internals is useful when writing custom Expressions, custom Database backends, or profiling complex ORM queries.

## Performance Impact

Minimizing AST depth and the number of table relations simplifies query compilation and reduces execution CPU time in Python.

## Common Mistakes

Modifying internal properties of `queryset.query` directly in application logic, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes.

## Interview Follow-up Questions

1. What is the difference between Query and QuerySet classes?
2. How does Django handle connection routing inside the compiler?
3. How does django.db.models.sql.where.WhereNode compile filter trees?
